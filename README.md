# adventure_pack_1

This is the first adventure pack to be released for adventure core. It is meant as an example and educational sample for showing off autobox and adventure core.

The assets are originally from a creator on steam workshop called "Vess", https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=537123363&searchtext=vess

I have not been able to get in contact with them and so cannot speak to the actual license of these model/texture assets. The other code in the mod I have purely created myself. 

I advise you to NOT include the assets from this modpack into any paid content of any kind, it is meant as an educational tool. 

All other assets are made by ExeVirus and are distributed as specified under LICENSE.txt
